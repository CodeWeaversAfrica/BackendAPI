#This file provides more information on how to set up docker in your local machine to run the project.

#Step 1.
Make sure you have Docker installed and set up in your  development environment.
Find more information on how to install and set up docker here:
- Docker Documentation Home: https://docs.docker.com/
For installation guides specific to different operating systems, you can visit the following pages:
- Install Docker on Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- Install Docker on Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
- Install Docker on Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/


#Step 2.
Make sure you have docker-compose installed and set-up in your development environment.
Find more information on how to install and set up docker-compose here:
-Docker Compose Documentation Home: https://docs.docker.com/compose/
For specific installation guides:
-Install Docker Compose on Linux: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
-Install Docker Compose on Mac and Windows: Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows. Installation instructions for Docker Desktop include Docker Compose:
-Docker Desktop for Mac: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
-Docker Desktop for Windows: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/

#Step 3
Make a .env.dev file using the template provided in the .env.dev.example file.
Feel free to use any credentials, however make sure the database credentials you put here match the credentials in the docker-compose.yaml file.

#Step 4
Run the command: 
make build-up 
to start the cointainers.

#Step 5
If you get an error when building the cointainer, something like this, "failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: exec: "/usr/src/backend/entrypoint.sh": permission denied: unknown" , dont panic. This project has some automations in the entrypoint.sh file, to proceed, just make the entrypoint.sh executable using this command or any of its variant depending on your system: chmod +x entrypoint.sh
then proceed to build and start the cointainers again using the command: make build-up
If it doesnt work, make sure you are using the correct command to make the entrypoint.sh executable depending on your system.

#Step 6
Check if the cointainers are running using this command: docker-compose ps

#Step 7
If the cointainers didnt build successfully, you might want to look at the logs and use them for debugging using this command: 
make logs

This command should be your go to incase you suspect your cointainers didnt build well or want to check for any errors or messages.

#Step 8
Once you make and save any changes in the code you will want to restart the cointainers, use these commands:
make down
make build-up

#NOTE - You dont have to make migrations since that is automated by the entrypoint.sh anytime you build the cointainer.
However the command is still available and you can access it and other commands you might use for this project in the commands.txt file

#If you exprience any permission related errors, make sure you are running these commands as the superuser in your system, or preceed them with sudo eg. sudo make build-up

#Happy Coding
